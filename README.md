# React-Axios-Fetch
M.I.T. Full Stack Web Development with MERN Course

Axios Fetch Assignment - The meaning behind this assignment was for us to find a 3rd party API source that would display a feed to our page.  I chose to use a quote api, that loads a new quote each time you click on the get quote button.

# Project Take Aways
I styled the page so that the quote displays in the center of a coral color background page.  I styled the button with a slight border radius, with customized background and hover effects.  Each time the "Get Quote" button is clicked it will load a new quote below the button.
